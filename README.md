# Support Engineer Challenge

## Notes

First of all, I would like to thank you for consideration. This was a great learning experience. 

## Things I was able to achieve:

- Routes, And NavLinks works, and lets you to navigate between the pages
- It connects to External API successfully 
- Styling includes materialise CSS, and font-awesome
- Input field renders typed info to the browser
- When you click to Lates Comics button it displays lates commics. You can alos unhide it. 

## Things I was not able to achieve and mistakes I made

- Unfortunetly, I was not able to filter the data from an external API. I need more practice and keep learning how to filter external API data to the browser.

- I guess, I also used not a best way to retrieve data from an API. Meaning, I used two API calls instead of one.
